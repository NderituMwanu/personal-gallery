# Project Title

My Personal Gallery

# Authors :

Gerald Nderitu


### Project Description

My Personal Gallery is a web-based application that displays images posted and details about them. The application allows the user to view different photos that interest them, click on a single photo and have it expanded to see the details, search for different categories, vie photos based on location and copy a link to the photo to share with friends.

### USER Stories 
```
1. View different photos that interest me.
2. Click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo. The photo details must appear on a modal within the
   same route as the main page.
3. Search for different categories of photos. (ie. Travel, Food)
4. Copy a link to the photo to share with my friends.
5. View photos based on the location they were taken.
```
## SetUp Instructions

Navigate to the desired location on your local machine and Clone or download this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/NderituMwanu/personal-gallery
```

You now have a copy of the repository on your computer.

Next, we have to use pip's latest version as well as python and a virtual environment.

For python, visit 
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```

### Install pip 

After youve downloaded python, open your terminal and type :

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
```
No need to create the virtual environment since you cloned it. But for future puropse you can create a virtual environment like this:

```
python3.8 -m venv --without-pip virtual
```

Install django via your terminal using: 
```
pip install django
```

Other packages you need to install, type the following:
```
1. pillow: for image uploads

2. Bootstrap
```

Django enables you to create an admin page so you can create a superuser and set the username and password.

After all has worked, you can now run:

```
python3.8 manage.py runserver
```

You can now use the url provided after you run this command with no errors to get access to the file.
